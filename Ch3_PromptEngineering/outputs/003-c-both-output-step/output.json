It meets all secondary criteria with 6 meals/snacks (exceeding 4-5), appropriate pre/post-workout timing, and compact presentation. However, the macronutrient distribution deviates from the stated goal of 'high carbohydrate intake'\u2014the actual 55% carbs falls below the 60% target, while protein at 27% is nearly double the 15% recommendation. This represents a meaningful deviation from the marathon preparation objective, though the plan remains nutritionally sound and practical. The minor calorie discrepancy in the pre-workout snack section is a presentation error rather than a substantive flaw."
