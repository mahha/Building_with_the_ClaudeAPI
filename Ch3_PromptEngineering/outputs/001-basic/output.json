    "reasoning": "The solution violates all three mandatory requirements. While it provides daily caloric totals and macronutrient percentages, it fails to deliver: (1) meals with exact foods, portions, and timing organized into a complete 1-day plan, (2) a structured schedule showing 4-5 meals/snacks with specific times, and (3) quantified portions necessary to verify the stated macronutrient targets. The output reads as a general nutrition guide rather than a compact, concise 1-day meal plan. A proper solution would show something like: '7:00 AM - Breakfast: 100g oats, 1 banana, 15g honey (X kcal, Y carbs, Z protein)' through the entire day."

    "score": 6,
    "reasoning": "The solution meets all mandatory requirements by including daily caloric total, macronutrient breakdown, and meals covering all eating occasions. However, it falls short on the critical detail level needed for a practical meal plan: portions are vague (e.g., 'oatmeal with peanut butter' without quantities), meal timing is absent, and there's no verification that the sample meals actually deliver the stated 150g protein target. The plan reads more as a framework/template than a concrete 1-day meal plan with actionable specifics. For a 'compact, concise' plan meant for quick reference, the lack of exact portions and timing significantly undermines usability."

    "reasoning": "The solution fails to meet all three MANDATORY requirements. While it provides good nutritional guidance and budget awareness, it lacks: (1) a daily caloric total, (2) a macronutrient breakdown with specific numbers, and (3) exact portions and clear meal structure. The plan reads more like general nutrition advice than a concrete 1-day meal plan with specific quantities. For a 68kg soccer athlete, caloric needs (~2,400-2,800 kcal) and macro targets (carbs/protein/fat ratios) are essential for pre-match preparation. The solution also doesn't clearly delineate breakfast, lunch, and dinner as separate meals with exact foods and portions."
