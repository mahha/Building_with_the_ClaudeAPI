Daily caloric total (3,235 kcal), macronutrient breakdown, and all 6 meals with exact portions and timing are clearly presented. The plan demonstrates sophisticated understanding of endurance nutrition with proper pre/post-workout timing and glycogen optimization. The only substantive weakness is carbohydrate percentage falling slightly short of the 55-65% target (50.8% actual), though the absolute carbohydrate amount (5.9g/kg) is scientifically sound for a 70kg marathon athlete. The format is well-organized with supporting tables, rationale, and practical guidance. All secondary criteria are met or exceeded."
