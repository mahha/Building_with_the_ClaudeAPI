✓ **Omega-3 sources:** Salmon for recovery and anti-inflammatory benefits  
✓ **Electrolytes:** Consider sodium intake during runs >90 minutes  
✓ **Easy to digest:** Simple carbs pre-workout; complex carbs post-workout

## Marathon Training Notes

- **Long run days:** Add +500 calories (primarily carbs)
- **Recovery days:** Reduce to 2,700 calories, maintain protein
- **Hydration during runs >90 min:** Sports drink with 6-8% carbs and electrolytes
- **Taper week:** Maintain calories but reduce volume; prioritize sleep</pre></td>

It provides a complete one-day meal plan with 6 meals/snacks, precise timing, exact portions, and detailed macronutrient information. The carbohydrate percentage (57.7%) falls squarely within the required 55-65% range for marathon preparation. Pre/post-workout nutrition is strategically timed and appropriately composed. The format is compact and professional with clear tables and actionable notes. The primary weakness is protein overages that slightly compromise the carbohydrate-focused macronutrient distribution, though this is a minor issue that doesn't undermine the plan's effectiveness.

## Key Nutrition Notes

✓ **High carb load:** 60% of calories supports soccer's intermittent sprint demands  
✓ **Strategic timing:** Post-training meal (lunch) prioritizes rapid glycogen replenishment  
✓ **Complete proteins:** Chicken, beef, tuna, eggs distribute amino acids evenly  
✓ **Budget-optimized:** Uses bulk staples (rice, oats, eggs, bread) under $15  
✓ **Recovery focus:** Balanced protein throughout day for muscle repair  
✓ **Match-day prep:** Easily digestible mid-morning carbs before afternoon training  
✓ **Hydration:** Add 3-4L water daily; increase to 4-5L on match days  

**Pre-Match Day Tip:** Reduce fiber slightly (less vegetables) 24 hours before match; maintain carb loading.</pre></td>
