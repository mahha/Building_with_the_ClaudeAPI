## **KEY NOTES FOR THIS ATHLETE**

✅ **Protein sources maximized:** Greek yogurt, eggs, lentils, quinoa, tofu, cottage cheese, nuts  
✅ **Carbs timed:** Higher around training (breakfast, pre/post-workout)  
✅ **Hydration:** Add 3-4L water daily + electrolytes on intense training days  
✅ **Supplementation to consider:** Creatine monohydrate, vitamin B12, iron (plant sources are less bioavailable)  
✅ **Flexibility:** Swap tofu for tempeh, paneer, or seitan; adjust portions based on training intensity</pre></td>

All secondary criteria are met—vegetarian sources are diverse and high-protein (Greek yogurt, eggs, lentils, quinoa, tofu, cottage cheese, nuts), macros are appropriately balanced for strength training at 1.95g protein/kg, and the format is compact and scannable. The minor protein powder ambiguity and generic hydration guidance are negligible issues that don't undermine the overall quality.

## MONEY-SAVING TIPS
✓ Buy chicken in bulk (rotisserie cheaper than raw)  
✓ Use frozen vegetables (cheaper, equally nutritious)  
✓ Buy oats & rice in bulk bins  
✓ Ground beef vs. premium cuts  
✓ Seasonal produce (bananas, apples are cheap year-round)
