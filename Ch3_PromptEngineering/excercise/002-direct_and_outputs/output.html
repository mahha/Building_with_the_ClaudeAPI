                <td class="prompt-inputs"><strong>content:</strong> Recent neuroimaging studies have illuminated the mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity during critical developmental windows, particularly how synaptic pruning refines neural circuits essential for cognitive development. During adolescence, the prefrontal cortex undergoes substantial reorganization through activity-dependent pruning of underutilized synapses, while simultaneously strengthening frequently activated neural pathways through long-term potentiation. This pruning process, regulated by glial cells and immune signaling molecules, directly influences executive function maturation and decision-making capacity. Furthermore, environmental enrichment and learning experiences modulate the extent and timing of synaptic elimination, demonstrating bidirectional interactions between experience-dependent plasticity and developmental trajectory. These findings suggest that disruptions in normal pruning patterns may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by atypical cognitive development and altered prefrontal function.</td>

                <td class="prompt-inputs"><strong>content:</strong> The Harlem Renaissance, flourishing during the 1920s and 1930s, represented a transformative period in African American cultural expression. Centered in New York City, this movement encompassed literature, visual arts, music, and theater, with figures like Langston Hughes revolutionizing poetry through vernacular language and jazz rhythms, while Aaron Douglas pioneered a distinctive visual style blending African motifs with modernist aesthetics. Simultaneously, the Great Migration brought unprecedented numbers of Black Americans northward, reshaping urban demographics and fostering intellectual exchange. The movement's emphasis on racial pride and cultural self-determination challenged prevailing stereotypes, though economic constraints of the Great Depression ultimately curtailed its momentum by the late 1930s. Scholars continue debating whether the Renaissance constituted a unified movement or a collection of individual artistic achievements responding to shared historical circumstances.</td>

However, it violates the secondary criterion about not over-segmenting closely related concepts.

                <td class="prompt-inputs"><strong>content:</strong> We employed a multi-scale climate modeling approach to investigate anthropogenic forcing mechanisms on regional precipitation patterns across the Arctic. Our methodology integrated coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models with high-resolution dynamical downscaling techniques, utilizing observational data from satellite radiometry and ground-based weather stations collected over the 1980-2023 period. Results indicate that greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 and methane, are responsible for 73% of observed warming trends, with albedo feedback mechanisms amplifying surface temperature changes by 40%. Policy implications suggest that achieving net-zero emissions targets by 2050 requires immediate mitigation strategies including renewable energy deployment, carbon pricing mechanisms, and international climate agreements. Our findings also reveal significant uncertainties in cloud parameterization schemes and ice-sheet dynamics that warrant further investigation through process-based modeling and field observations.</td>

Regarding secondary criteria, the extraction successfully identifies domain-specific topics and separates scientific phenomena from policy recommendations. However, there is some ambiguity in whether certain items (dynamical downscaling, satellite radiometry, ground-based weather stations) should be classified as 'topics' versus 'methodological descriptions.'
